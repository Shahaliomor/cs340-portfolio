**How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
In Project One, I built a CRUD Python module that connected the dashboard to the MongoDB database. By separating the CRUD functionality into its own module, my code became easier to maintain, test, and reuse. This modular design allowed me to plug the CRUD functions directly into Project Two’s dashboard without rewriting database logic. In the future, I could adapt this same CRUD module for other projects that need database interaction, which saves time and ensures consistency.

**How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?**  
For this course, I approached Grazioso Salvare’s requirements by breaking down the problem into smaller steps: first ensuring the database was set up correctly, then creating CRUD operations, and finally connecting those operations to interactive dashboard widgets. Compared to previous assignments, this project required me to think more like a systems designer—focusing not only on solving the immediate problem, but also on how different components (database, Python code, and dashboard) integrate together. In the future, I would continue to use this structured approach, starting with client requirements, then designing the database schema, and finally implementing features in modular, testable pieces.

**What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?**  
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by creating efficient software and systems. In this project, my work allowed Grazioso Salvare to better analyze and visualize animal shelter data. This kind of solution matters because it helps companies make data-driven decisions quickly. For example, the dashboard gives their team an easy way to track animal outcomes and trends, improving how they manage resources and ultimately saving more animals’ lives. My contribution reflects how computer science enables organizations to be more effective and impactful in their mission.
